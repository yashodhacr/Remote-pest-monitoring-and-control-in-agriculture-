# Remote-pest-monitoring-and-control-in-agriculture

## Overview
Remote Pest Monitoring and Control in Agriculture is a powerful tool that helps farmers and agricultural professionals monitor crop health and detect pest risks through the analysis of satellite imagery and vegetation indices. This solution leverages cutting-edge remote sensing technology to provide timely, data-driven insights into pest infestations, enabling better decision-making and more sustainable farming practices.

By using metrics like Normalized Difference Vegetation Index,Chlorophyll Absorption in Bandwidth andLeaf Area Index, this dashboard empowers farmers to:

- Detect early signs of pest infestations.
- Track vegetation health over time.
- Make proactive decisions for pest management.T
 
## Features
- Field Overview: View all your fields on a map along with key indicators of pest risk.
- Vegetation Indices: Analyze vegetation health using:
- - NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index): Detect plant stress, which could indicate pest damage.
- - CAB (Chlorophyll Absorption in Bandwidth): Monitor plant chlorophyll content, a key marker of photosynthesis.
- - LAI (Leaf Area Index): Track canopy density and plant growth.
- True-Color Imagery: Visualize your fields with true-color satellite imagery for a real-time view of crop conditions.
- Pest Risk Alerts: Receive notifications when vegetation indices suggest a potential pest issue.
- Time-Series Analysis: Track vegetation metrics over time to identify trends and anomalies.
- Field Management: Add new fields by drawing boundaries on a map and specifying crop type and season.


## Usage
### Home Page
- The home page displays a map of all your fields with pest risk levels indicated by color.
- Choose any field to begin exploring vegetation metrics and satellite imagery.

### Vegetation Metrics and Imagery
- View Index Maps: Select a field and a date to view vegetation indices such as NDVI, CAB, and LAI.
- True-Color Imagery: Use satellite imagery in true color to monitor crop conditions and assess possible pest damage.
- Pest Risk Alerts: Based on deviations in vegetation indices, receive alerts for potential pest risks in specific fields.

### Time-Series Charts
- Track crop health over the growing season with detailed time-series charts for metrics like NDVI, CAB, and LAI.
- Identify patterns that may indicate stress or pest-related damage.

### Adding New Fields
- Navigate to the "Add Field" page, where you can draw the boundaries of your field directly on the map.
- Input relevant details such as crop type (e.g., wheat, corn, rice) and growing season to start monitoring the field.

## Future Work
- Predictive Pest Models: Utilize machine learning models to predict pest outbreaks based on historical data and current field conditions.
- Weather Data Integration: Incorporate real-time weather data to enhance pest detection and risk predictions.
- Field Comparisons: Compare multiple fields to understand which are most affected by pests.
- Mobile Integration: Develop a mobile-friendly version of the dashboard for real-time pest monitoring on-the-go.
